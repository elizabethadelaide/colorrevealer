# colorrevealer

Uses tracking.js with html canvas.

Allows experimentation with 2D rendering and object tracking, particularly with effects from compositing (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial/Compositing).

Some of the effect combinations will have unexpected results, some will not work! There's plenty of options (13,824 for effects alone).
